## About Me

I am currently a research scientist at Netflix, working on creating high-quality and controllable image generation tools. I obtained my D.Phil. in Computer Science at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk), co-supervised by Profs. [Niki Trigoni](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/niki.trigoni/) and [Andrew Markham](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/andrew.markham/). My study is generously supported by the Taiwanese Government Scholarship to Study Abroad, ACE-OPS grant, and St. Catherine's College Overseas Scholarship. 

I also had the privilege of collaborating closely with [Matheus Gadelha](http://mgadelha.me/), [Thibault Groueix](https://imagine.enpc.fr/~groueixt/), [Matthew Fisher](https://techmatt.github.io/), [Soren Pirk](https://storage.googleapis.com/pirk.io/index.html), and [Radomir Mech](https://research.adobe.com/person/radomir-mech/) during my internships at Adobe Research, and [Varun Jampani](https://varunjampani.github.io/), [Prafull Sharma](https://prafullsharma.net/), and [Mark Boss](https://markboss.me/) during my internship at Stability AI. Prior to my D.Phil., I worked as a research assistant in Computer Vision Lab, Academia Sinica, supervised by Profs. [Tyng-Luh Liu](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/liutyng/) and [Hwann-Tzong Chen](https://htchen.github.io). 


## Research Interests

Modern generative models excel at generalization but struggle to deliver the fine-grained, precise controls over attributes such as camera or object appearances. In contrast, traditional renderers offer parameter-level manipulation—yet remain confined to their fixed libraries of 3D objects and PBR materials.

My research aims to bring the best of two worlds -- enhancing generative models with intuitive 3D-aware controls without losing any of its generalizability for creative content generation, essentially making them into *flexible* renderers. So far, I have worked on controlling camera/light source/motion movements ([Continuous 3D Words](https://ttchengab.github.io/continuous_3d_words/)), and more recently on material transfer ([ZeST](https://ttchengab.github.io/zest/)), blending, and parameteric control ([MARBLE](https://marblecontrol.github.io)).
